## Introduction:


## Technologies
Express, MongoDB, Bootstrape,
Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML.

Tell us, on a high-level what technologies you are going to use to build the game
Tell us how you plan on implementing the difficult parts


## MVP
* The target cursor to interact with the moving object.
* scores points when each object is clicked
* calculate total scores


## Goals
create an effect similar to the dog picking up the dead duck after each shot.
lose 2 birds then game over


## Stretch Goals
configure different scores base on how long it takes for the player to shoot the moving object


## Timeline
What do you need to have done by
* Monday - I should have a canvas with the background field that has ground, grass, trees and a moving target cursor.
* Tuesday - I should have at least 1 moving objects to shoot in 1 round and the object either explode or change image.
* Wednesday - for each moving object shot - keep scoring and determine wins.
* Thursday - set up round 2 if possible with faster moving object


## Wireframes
You can use whatever you want to make these (it can just be a drawing)
This must be checked into your repo and displayed in this section
If it's a drawing you can take a picture with your phone and upload it :)
