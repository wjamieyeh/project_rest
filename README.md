## Introduction:
Guess if the displayed quote is from Ron Swanson. (Parks and Rec character) "Are you a real Ron Swanson fan?" OR
same concept but pulling instagram photos by locations in LA and guess those locations. "How well do you know LA"

## Technologies
Tell us, on a high-level what technologies you are going to use to build the game
* Express, MongoDB, Bootstrape, Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML.

Tell us how you plan on implementing the difficult parts
To figure out how to alternate his real quotes vs made up ones that I will create.


## MVP
* Have the backend to successfully get Ron Swanson's quotes from https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes
* The page will have the character's photo, quote, and text display that asks if this is his real quote from the series.
* A round will tests a player up to 10 random quotes - 3 wrongs then player will get the message that you are not a real fan.


## Goals
I'd like to add additional comic effects each time when a player guessed right and wrong.
set up a timer for each Yes/No quote.


## Stretch Goals
add more characters and populate my database with their quotes or facts.



## Timeline
What do you need to have done by
* Monday - set up GET homepage with ejs view. my page should have the functionality that can add quotes.
* Tuesday - set up the rest - update quote and delete quote from my database.
* Wednesday - finish all front end prettiness.
* Thursday - test and validate display for demo
